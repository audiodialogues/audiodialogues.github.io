                <b>Abstract. </b> Existing datasets for audio understanding primarily focus on single-turn interactions (i.e. audio caption-
                ing, audio question answering) for describing audio in
                natural language, limiting understanding audio via interactive dialogue. To address this gap, we introduce
                Audio Dialogues, a multi-turn dialogue dataset containing 160k samples for general audio sounds and music. In
                addition to dialogues, Audio Dialogues also has question/answer pairs to understand and compare multiple
                input audios together. Audio Dialogues leverages a
                prompting-based approach and caption annotations from
                existing datasets to generate multi-turn dialogues using
                a Large Language Model (LLM). We evaluate existing
                audio-augmented large language models on our proposed
                dataset demonstrati</b>.

                                Audio 1: This is a Christmas music piece with heavy influences from Celtic music.
                                There is a female vocalist singing melodically as the lead. The melodic background is
                                provided by the strings and the piano and at the same time Celtic instruments that
                                resemble a harp and a dulcimer. There is a calming and positive aura to this piece. It
                                could be playing in the background at a Christmas party. It could also be used in
                                Christmas-themed shows or social media content.<br>
                                Audio 2: This music is a spirited instrumental. The tempo is fast with an animated
                                Piano harmony, synthesizer arrangements, synthesised violins, rhythmic digital drums,
                                funky bass lines and electronic sounds. The music is superimposed over sounds of tapping
                                and rhythmic beeping. The music is happy, perky, upbeat, enthusiastic, lively and
                                spirited.<br>
                                Audio 3: This is a lullaby that features a main melody made with a xylophone that has
                                a bright sound. A sustained piano synth creates a dreamy and sleepy ambience sound. A
                                subtle cello plays single chords that bounce from one beat to the next. This is a song a
                                baby could fall asleep to.<br>
